A live version can be viewed at www.krishlist.com

Classified ads listing web application modeled after craigslist.com. Polymorphic, compound associations to DRY-ly create,
view, and filter for ads in 100+ idiosyncratic ad categories and to enable alerts to notify offline users
of newly posted ads that meet their criteria. UJS and Backbone for client-side filtering and new-ad-posting
based on idiosyncratic ad attributes.
