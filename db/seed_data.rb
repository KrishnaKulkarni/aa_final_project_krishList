    "So my roommates all left because of a job thing and I need to make rent. I really think this place is great and I've been living here for a while (incumbency FTW!). I don't want to leave but the utilities are a real bitch to afford on your own. Some facts about the digs:

It's about 775,000 square feet. Yeah, it's big, I know. But don't let the size alone fool you! It's cozy too--lots of individual rooms!

Location, location, location. It's close to everything you could possibly want. The Botanical Gardens (they're temporarily closed, but don't let that stop you); the metro, and plenty of bars. The bars are important, because what else are we gonna do?

It's historic too! It was built in like 1800 something. Don't ask me the specifics, there's a plaque somewhere. Let's just say it's pretty sweet. There are plenty of cool things inside, like a giant statue of King Kamehameha I. It makes for weird midnight runs to the bathroom, but whatever.

Wanna know more just ask!

About you: Must be LGBT friendly. Must not be a Republican. Don't be racist. Don't hate women. Must think poor Americans are people.

Oh, and don't be an Eagles fan, because, gross.

"As summer is approaching that means the weather outside is getting nicer, which means I have an extra room for rent. Do you like the outdoors, wood paneling, porta-poties? Then I have the perfect room for you. I just cleaned and swept out the tree house in my backyard. It is level to the second story of my house on a very sturdy tree. It has a plastic door, solid roof, and a durable rope ladder. It also has a pully system so you can pull up items that you don't feel comfortable carrying on the rope ladder. The tree house has a bedroom (comes furnished with a mattress) which is separate from the common area (comes furnished with a beanbag). As for the kitchen, you may want to eat out. You can use the separate entrance to my backyard where it is located. This DOES NOT mean you have free access to my backyard though. What you are renting is the room at this is it. It is okay to use the backyard but keep it mind that first and foremost, it is mine. 

Please, applicants under 160lbs only please. It is a sturdy building but lets not take any chances. ",
" am a cat nutritionist offering a room in an apartment with a GREAT location (7rd and 3rd) for a very cheap price. $400/month for june, july, august. I am an extreme cat lover and have a total of 17 cats in a small apartment. I am not going to lie, you must be an extreme cat lover if you want to rent this place for the summer. 

The room I am offering up for rent is a room for my cats. I am not going to lie, there is cat litter and droppings all over the room as I have not cleaned it since the middle of January. There is a twin bed on it which about 5 cats sleep in. You are welcome to share it with them, but you must NOT disturb them, as it is their place before yours. You are welcome to clean up some of the droppings, but you must leave most of the cat litter in place in the room, as there will not be much more room in the house for the cats to do their business otherwise. I am not going to lie, sometimes I wake up and have cat litter all over my body, but studies show that it is extremely sterile and will not cause you any sickness if you bathe daily and keep clean. 

If interested, please send me an email explaining your situation, and writing a short blurb (essay, history, poem, whatever) about your love of cats. I reserve the right to revoke your room (with a refund) at any time if I feel that my cats are more depressed or are not enjoying your company. ",
"Here's the deal. I have a BIG lovely stationwagon with 5 cupholders, cloth interior, 6 tube hooka, large ash tray, leopard trash bag, and tinted windows. 

This is a one person stationwagon rental. I am asking for $175.00 per month and all other expenses are paid. However, you are reponsible for washing the windshield, morning defrosting, and oil changes. 

I work from 9:00am- 7:00pm weekdays......SO THE CAR-APARTMENT will not be available at those times for entertaining, sleeping, or cooking. Weekends are flexible. 

The CAR-APARTMENT is furnished with a futon, one yellow pillow, a stuffed care-bear, and some left-over candy wrappers. (I like candy) Sometimes I like to leave my tenants snacks and such. 

Of course you will have have to live/rent the CAR APARTMENT in my drive-way. It's quite nice and near the Berkeley Capus, 7-11, various neighborhood bars, and a laundromat. If you ask nicely I can even park my car at the laundromat so you have easy access to clean your clothing.

"I am an avid fan of George R. R. Martin's series Game of Thrones (both the books and the show). I have recently purchased a replica of the Iron Throne as seen in the television show, and need a partner to play out an elaborate fanatsy.
In my fantasy, I am Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, and Rightful Heir to the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. After crossing the Narrow Sea and defeating the forces of Westeros, it is within my power and right to slay all of those who betrayed my family and denied me my rightful place for so many years. The most vile enemies of house Targaryen, House Stark and House Baratheon must pay the highest price. All of those who fought against the Mother of Dragons are slain - all except one. When I come to Robb Stark, out eyes lock and something moves inside of me. I realize I need to have him, want him, and I can tell he is thinking the same. I order my guards to throw him in the dungeon and later that night, I have him brought to me, in the throne room. There, on the Iron Throne I've so recently won, I make wild and passionate love with him, repeatedly. 
Please only respond to this post if you look like Robb Stark! I would appreciate pictures, but please, no names. In order to stay as true to the fantasy as possible, I ONLY want you to refer to yourself as Robb Stark. You will need to provide your own clothing. Please keep in mind that you will have recently participated in a battle and been thrown in a dungeon, so you will not be wearing your nicest furs. 
I'm looking for a Stark in the streets but a wildling in the sheets.

"Yes, it's true, I've never seen Star Wars. I was 14 years old when the original came out (you do the math) and somehow I never managed to see it, or any of the sequels.

It's time. I'm ready to hand in my Star Wars V-card.

I know this might seem like pretty hot stuff to some of you, introducing a Star Wars virgin to the film that shaped you into the person that you are, developed your sense of virtue and cultivated your concepts of right and wrong. Imagine how hot will it be to sit next to me as I experience -- for the first time! -- the foundation upon which you've not only built your entire personality, but with which you've cultivated the purpose of your heart and the direction of your soul. It will be no less than miraculous, I'm sure. A spiritual epiphany.

This is a one-time offer. I mean, once it's busted, there's no getting my Star Wars cherry back, ya know? So I want it to be good. I want my first time to be memorable. Special. I want the build-up, the excitement, the breathless anticipation, all of it. I want you to tease me with your superior Star Wars wisdom until I'm begging you to please please PLEASE put it in, put it in!! Put the DVD in the player and start the movie! I want you to hold my hand as I submit for the first time to the marvel and wonder of this grand event. I might even be okay with some costumes and role playing before the movie starts, but I'd have to be really comfortable with you. Size matters (no matter what they tell you), so obscenely large screens to the front of the line, and surround sound is a must.

So how about it? Do you think you are the one to cure me of my Star Wars purity? Tell me why.

**Please note this is NOT an offer or request for any sort of sexual activity but I probably won't want to see you again, which is why I consider this a casual encounter.**",



"Be a sweetheart.

If you're just looking to get laid, be a normal person. Ask for someone to sleep with you. Be less vulgar and kinky and gross. At the end of the day, do you ever get the cum slut or cock slave you're looking for? No. Wouldn't you rather just actually get laid? 

I post ads because I look through page after page of postings here and never want to respond. Not to a single one. Because they are weird or gross, so I assume the person writing them is also weird and gross. 

I long for an ad that is simple, straightforward, and honest. Because that is the kind of man I want to sleep with. The bar is full of pretenders and drunkards. Ew. I assume most real women who come are CL are like me. Normal, but with a heavy sexual appetite. No time for dating and no patience for the intensity of a relationship. 

All we want is to find a nice career man who can find 45 minutes 3-4 times a week to fuck. Maybe the occasional over night cause we all need some cuddles, and intimacy is a beautiful thing. But you don't need to meet my parents or siblings, and I don't need to meet yours. Our friends know about each other's existence. We're the booty call. Maybe we watch TV together while we drink a beer to get in the mood. And we can talk about stuff too. Current events, work, etc. But we should really only see each other in each other's homes. 

So, if you have some weird fetish, keep it up. But, if you can put that yucky stuff aside and just enjoy the company of a woman, write your posting accordingly. And, if you're sweet enough, you'll get a response and a picture from the kind of women you actually want to come over. 

Good luck, Bucko!

"This Sunday evening at 10pm, I'll be sitting at the counter of Waffle House on Tunnel Road. I'll be wearing clothing but underneath I'll be naked. You'll know it's me because I'll be eating Bert's BEST bowl of Chili. Please note that Bert's BEST is a large bowl of chili, smothered, covered, chunked and peppered. This clarification is important, just in case there is someone else at the counter eating a bowl of Bert's Chili, which is just chili and not as good as Bert's BEST. 
After you identify me by my chili and also perhaps by my concealed nakedness, you'll take the stool beside me. At first I won't be sure it's you and the anticipation will be a real thrill for me. When the waitress greets you... I'm not sexist it's just statisticaly probable that your server will be a female because male Waffle House servers are very rare. Anyway, when your waitress greets you, you won't need to review a menu because I'm about to tell you what to order and you'll have it memorized. It may be a good idea to write this down on a small piece of paper and memorize while you're driving to the Tunnel Road Waffle House. Ready? Good. You'll tell the waitress you'll have Hashbrowns, covered, diced, peppered and topped. Curiously enough, topped means topped with Burt's Chili. The other code words stand for melted cheese, grilled tomatoes, and spicy jalapeno peppers, respectively. I mention this because often times people don't care for spicy foods, in which case you can substitute capped for peppered. Capped is the code word for grilled button mushrooms. Either way, I'll still know it's you. Yet just to be sure, in addition to the Hashbrowns, order a city ham biscuit from the DOLLAR$ MENU. Of course it's possible that you may not like City Ham. The name itself can conjur unpleasant connotations if you think too long about it. This isn't important though because you don't have to eat it. It's just something off the DOLLAR$ MENU that you'll order it so I can be sure you're you and not just someone else that happens to be ordering Hashbrowns, covered, diced, 
peppered and topped. 
After you order and only after the waitress has walked away, I'll ask you if you'd like a spoonful of my Bert's BEST Bowl of Chili. Don't respond verbally, just looked me in the eyes, squint slightly in a seductive manner and then open your mouth, stick out your tongue and get ready for a spoonful of Bert's BEST. Taste the chili, the sautéed onions, melted cheese, grilled hickory smoked ham and spicy jalepeno peppers. It doesn't matter if you like the spicy peppers or not. You're going to eat them and they're going to be HOT! So hot your salivation may carry a little piece of grilled hickory smoked ham from the corner of your mouth down the precipice of your chin. Don't wipe it off, let it drip. 
When my body stops covulsing and my emotions return from sheer ecstacy, I'll put a $20 bill on the counter. Then I'll get up slowly and walk out the door. Never to see you again. 
If this sounds like the kind of thing you're looking for, email me to set up a time to meet. I know I said I'd be there tonight at 10 pm but if more then one woman showed up it would cause confusion. Also I'd like to make sure you're not a weirdo before we meet.

  'for sale'  => ["Toyota MR2, lovingly dubbed 'Yoda the Toyota'

*Read in the mighty, stoic voice of one who has conquered lands and stolen hearts*

From the mighty forges of Japan, this behemoth of a sports car was once hailed as a 'Ferrari killer' (presumably, if you crash into one, this still holds true). Styled lovingly after a folded origami structure, mortal beings stand in awe at its merest sight, swoon uncontrollably at its sonorous roar, and faint at the thought of one day sitting in its passenger seat, eyes wide as you heroically blast towards your destination - their heart. 

A machine worthy of the gods indeed. Here are some cold hard facts to back that up. Buckle up. 

Engine - I'm told it's from a '94 and only has 100,000 miles on it, although I have no evidence to back that up, nor any reason to believe it's true. UPDATE - IT'S TRUE! Confirmed by previous owner. Lovingly installed in years past by a nameless American Hero, this beauty is dripping with DIY charm. Not going to lie, it leaks a little oil, but don't all great things? Would we have made it to the moon if we had been afraid of a little motor oil? Maybe. I've been told that this oil is coming from the oil pan gasket. Not sure when this thing last had an oil change...but that might be a good place to start.

Air Intake - Without a doubt my favorite part of the car. Whoever dropped the engine into this stallion could not for the life of them figure out how to hook it up to the air intake. Solution? Cut a hole in the bodywork and install an air intake. Perfect. What to use under the hood? What's more Kona than a big ass coffee can, the bottom of which has since rusted through? What's more American than Apple Pie and Freedom? Exactly. 

5-speed manual - I'm told the clutch was replaced recently. I've also been told that it says gullible on the ceiling over my head. Moral of the story, some people aren't to be trusted. Works fine, and it's sticky enough to roll-start the car. Oh right, you'll be doing that a lot. It becomes second-nature a few weeks in. 

Straight Pipes - Someone put straight pipes on Yoda years ago. Now he yodels like a drunken pirate being electrocuted by the very car battery that is currently failing to supply your starter motor with adequate juice. That said, being in this car is a multi-sensory experience, and also an epic adventure. 

Star Wars References - Also a survivor of the 1980s, Yoda the Toyota is small, green (lie), was once strong, and will die on you the day you need him most.

Sound System - By some christmas miracle, the poorly-installed CD player works, and cranks music out of the (fittingly ugly) mediocre sound system. Two FM-radio transmitters are in the car somewhere, as are various pens and pencils, some old cds, and possibly a winning lottery ticket. 

Bad Guys - As far as I know, there are no mummies, pirates (space or otherwise), vampires, or demons currently living in the car. Two adults up to 6'5 can fit in there comfortably though, inviting many clown car references. Clowns are bad.

Rims and Tires - This car has both. Also included in the price of admission is an entire extra set of wheels and tires, practically brand new (I think)! Yay for small victories!

Hazard Lights - Danger Will Robinson...these aren't working right now. Not quite sure why, but I assume it has to do with the orange extension cords. Currently, one of the only things (...) keeping it from passing inspection. 



FAQs -

Will it turn over when it's hot?

Probably not.

Is this the car of your dreams? 

Duh. 

Is the registration good? 

Do pigs fly? No. Less than a year bad though!

Will it pass inspection? 

Ehh...with a little love and tenderness? Probablyish. 

Why are you selling such a glorious piece of sex metal?

In a word? Cantaloupe. In a sentence? I'm likely moving off-island in the summer, and, foreseeing overwhelming demand for this beauty, I've decided to start early",

"It's with a heavy heart that I must relinquish possession of my beloved coffee table.

As you've undoubtedly noticed by the picture provided, it's a most unique and handsome coffee table; it's capacious multi-layers and glimmering sheen is the centre piece of any living room.

I know by now you think it sounds like not only the perfect coffee table, but also the ideal accent piece to any room, and you'd almost be right. Almost. 

It's asymmetrical beauty comes with a steep and ominous cost. It has roughly 10 metal, kinda sharp corners, in varying heights and angles and therefore punishes the heedless and ungraceful with leg abrasions at every turn, and the only way it could be anymore lethal to toddlers is if you put it at the bottom of an unattended swimming pool.

It's structure is robust; chrome and thick glass. I'm not sure what it's exact dimensions are and eyeballing without getting of my chair, I'd estimate 4 foot by 3 feet and like, average coffee table height, but it'd be different in metric.

I don't know how much it weighs, but it's metal and glass so let's just go with 'a lot for a coffee table.'

It also has a slight mar in it's beauty in the form of a shallow, 3 inch chip in the corner of it's glass top.

If, after searching your soul, you believe this coffee table is destined to yours, it can be made so with a mere pittance of $40, roughly 10% of it's original price.

It also comes with a matching side table, that frankly I don't much care for.",

"Please come rid me of this Gold's Gym Elliptical Machine. I got it a year ago from a friend who had only used it as a coat rack. 'That won't be me,' I said, 'I'll definitely use it,' I swore. My roommate laughed and my friends made bets about the amount of times I'd actually step on it. Unfortunately, those punk asses were all right. Staring at it just reminds me of my lack of ambition, and it's also taking up valuable space where I'd like to put a big beautiful white desk. The kind of furniture that not only allows me to feel good about my sedentary lifestyle, but actually encourages it under the guise of scholarly betterment.

The price is freakishly low at $50, which I figure is just about enough to cover a pizza party for my roommates and me. But the sweetest part will be going to bed, my stomach achingly full of Crispy Basil's cuban specialty pizza, and not being mocked by the unforgiving atrocity taking up half my bedroom.

I also added a photo of my cat, because he's dope.",
"Christmas Cheer.

For anyone feeling a little low this festive season I have decided to sell off some of my Christmas Cheer. I have had plenty of happy Christmases so I am happy to have a lousy one this year if it means someone else will have a good one.

I have managed to trap the Cheer in a plastic shopping bag but I'm not sure how long it will stay there so looking for a quick sale.

Happy to negotiate a price, I just want to see the Cheer go to a good home.
